# Decision Tree Machine Learning Notebook

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Decission_Tree.ipynb`) that demonstrates the implementation of a **Decision Tree** algorithm for supervised machine learning. The notebook walks through data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results using Python.

The project is intended for **learning, academic, and demonstration purposes**, especially for students and beginners in Machine Learning.
